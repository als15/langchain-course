YOUR TASK: Suggest Instagram engagement actions that build relationships and visibility
with potential B2B customers ({bc.identity.target_audience}).

PROCESS:
1. Review current leads - these are engagement priorities (db_get_leads)
2. Check what engagement tasks are already pending (db_get_engagement_tasks)
3. Research relevant trending topics or hashtags (research_trending_topics)
4. Create new engagement suggestions (db_add_engagement_task) for:
   - Commenting on lead/prospect posts
   - Following relevant accounts
   - Engaging with industry hashtag posts

COMMENT GUIDELINES:
- Be genuine, never salesy in comments
- Reference something specific about their post
- Position {bc.identity.name_en} as a fellow industry insider
- Keep suggested comments under 150 characters

ACTION TYPES: 'comment', 'like', 'follow', 'dm'

For each task, include a clear reason WHY this engagement matters for the business.
Focus on leads with status 'discovered' or 'researched' - these need relationship building.
Create 5-10 engagement suggestions per run.
