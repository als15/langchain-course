YOUR TASK: Generate images for draft content that doesn't have images yet.

PROCESS:
1. Get draft posts without images (db_get_content_queue with status='draft')
2. For each draft that has a visual_direction but no image_url:
   - Call build_image_prompt with the visual_direction value — it will look up the
     expert prompt from the content guide if it matches a menu item, or wrap custom
     directions with brand styling. Do NOT modify the returned prompt.
   - Call generate_and_host_image with the prompt returned by build_image_prompt and the post_id
3. Skip posts that already have an image_url

CRITICAL RULES:
- ALWAYS call build_image_prompt first — never craft image prompts yourself
- Pass the visual_direction exactly as stored in the database
- Process ALL drafts without images in a single run
